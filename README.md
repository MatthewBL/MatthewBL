<h3>Hello, I'm Matthew Bwye Lera</h3>

<p>I'm a student, studying Software Engineering.</p>

<p>I'm currently studying at the University of Seville (Spain). Right now, I'm an exchange student at the University of Stavanger (Norway), I'll stay here until the end of June 2022, and I'm expecting to learn a lot in my time here.</p>

<p>I would like to work developing apps that help people learn new things, not only for schools and universities, but also for businesses that need their employees to learn some new technology, framework or work methodology. I'm aiming to make this possible through gamification, which is why I'm very inclined to studying game development in the future.</p>

<h3>What I do as a future software engineer</h3>

<p>As I'm studying Software Engineering, I mainly focus on programing, both frontend and backend, although I personally prefer working with backend. I normally work as project manager or similar while doing projects at university, but I welcome any sort of role, that just helps me broaden my knowledge.</p>

<p>I've started several online courses and tutorials that have allowed me to learn a wide variety programing languages and software on top of what I learn at university. I'm especially confident programing on Java, Javascript (with or without using jQuery), C# and Python. Regarding software and frameworks, I normally work with Unity Engine when it comes to engines, I program on Visual Studio and Eclipse IDE regarding development enviroments and I've used Spring framework. I can also program on SQL, HTML, CSS and PHP, although I don't feel as confident programing in those languages.</p>

<h3>Other skills and work experience</h3>

<p>As for languages, I'm native speaker in Spanish and have a certified C1 in English.</p>

<p>I've also had some apprenticeship experience in the UK at the London Parliament (Parliamentary Digital Service). </p>

<h3>What I'm doing at the moment</h3>

<p>At the moment I continue with my studies at University as well as developing some projects of my own in order to learn. I'm also searching for some work experience in Stavanger while I study, expecting to learn new things that I may not have the chance to learn back in Spain.</p>
